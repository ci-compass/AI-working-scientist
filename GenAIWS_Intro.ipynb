    "\n",
    "Great question! The transformer architecture is indeed often described as \"autocomplete on steroids,\" but there's something deeper happening that we're still trying to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key mystery is **emergence** - capabilities that appear seemingly out of nowhere as models scale up. Small models do behave mostly like fancy autocomplete, but larger models start exhibiting behaviors they weren't explicitly trained for, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reasoning through multi-step problems\n",
    "- Translating between languages they've barely seen\n",
    "- Understanding analogies and abstract concepts\n",
    "- Performing arithmetic (even though they're just predicting text!)\n",
    "\n",
    "This connects to that \"grokking\" phenomenon you saw in the notes - where a model suddenly generalizes after appearing to just memorize. But at the scale of models like GPT-4 or Claude, we see this happening across many different capabilities simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we don't understand:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why certain capabilities emerge at specific model sizes** - there seem to be \"phase transitions\" where new abilities suddenly appear\n",
    "2. **How the models actually represent knowledge internally** - the Anthropic \"Transformer Circuits\" work is trying to reverse-engineer this\n",
    "3. **Whether there are fundamental limits** to what emerges with scale, or if we'll keep seeing new capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you thought about what kinds of capabilities you'd want to investigate or understand better? Or are you curious about how researchers are trying to \"look inside\" these models?"
