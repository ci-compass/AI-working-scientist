    "Think of an LLM as a kind of supercharged text predictor: you give it a sequence of tokens (words or subwords) and it predicts the next token, then the next, etc. What we call the context window is simply how many tokens the model can look back at when making each prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a model has a context window of, say, 4,096 tokens, then when it’s about to predict token N, it only “knows” about tokens N-4,095 through N-1 (plus whatever internal state) — it cannot directly “see” tokens older than that.\n",

    "### Why does the Context Window Matter?\n",
    "1. **Scope of what the model knows in this invocation -- Stateless Model**\n",
    "> Because the model cannot remember everything ever said, only what fits into its window — if you want it to reference a piece of text, you must include it (or a compressed version of it) in the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Management of context = performance trade-offs**\n",
    "> The more tokens you feed (longer history, more retrieved docs, more examples), the richer the information the model has — but you are limited by the window size. If you exceed it, older tokens get truncated (lost). If you fill it with irrelevant stuff, you can confuse the model (context noise) rather than help it. Karpathy calls this “the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Analogy: human coworker with short-term memory**\n",
    "> Karpathy uses an analogy: the LLM is like a coworker who has anterograde amnesia — they forget everything beyond a short timeframe. So if you want them to reference something older, you must remind them (i.e., re-include it in the window)."

It can be used to create more developer-friendly documentation, CLI, etc tools.\\\\n\\\\n## Why?\\\\n\\\\nWithout docments, if you want to document your parameters, you have to repeat param names in docstrings, since they\\u2019re already in the function signature. The parameters have to be kept synchronized in the two places as you change your code. Readers of your code have to look back and forth between two places to understand what\\u2019s happening. So it\\u2019s more work for you, and for your users.\\\\n\\\\nFurthermore, to have parameter documentation formatted nicely without docments, you have to use special magic docstring formatting, often with [odd quirks](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62167540/why-do-definitions-have-a-space-before-the-colon-in-numpy-docstring-sections), which is a pain to create and maintain, and awkward to read in code. For instance, using [numpy-style documentation](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef add_np(a:int, b:int=0)->int:\\\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"The sum of two numbers.\\\\n\\\\n    Used to demonstrate numpy-style docstrings.\\\\n\\\\nParameters\\\\n----------\\\\na : int\\\\n    the 1st number to add\\\\nb : int\\\\n    the 2nd number to add (default: 0)\\\\n\\\\nReturns\\\\n-------\\\\nint\\\\n    the result of adding `a` to `b`\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\\n    return a+b\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nBy comparison, here\\u2019s the same thing using docments:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef add(\\\\n    a:int, # the 1st number to add\\\\n    b=0,   # the 2nd number to add\\\\n)->int:    # the result of adding `a` to `b`\\\\n    \\\"The sum of two numbers.\\\"\\\\n    return a+b\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\n## Numpy docstring helper functions\\\\n\\\\n[`docments`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/docments.html#docments) also supports numpy-style docstrings, or a mix or numpy-style and docments parameter documentation.

[`FixSigMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#fixsigmeta) fixes this issue and restores signatures.\\\\n\\\\nTo understand what [`FixSigMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#fixsigmeta) does, it is useful to inspect an object\\u2019s signature. You can inspect the signature of an object with `inspect.signature`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass T:\\\\n    def __init__(self, a, b, c): pass\\\\n\\\\ninspect.signature(T)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (a, b, c)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis corresponds to tab completion working in the normal way:\\\\n\\\\n![Tab completion in a Jupyter Notebook.](images/att_00005.png)\\\\n\\\\nHowever, when you inherhit from a class that defines `__new__` or a metaclass that defines `__call__` this obfuscates the signature by overriding your class with the signature of `__new__`, which prevents tab completion from displaying useful information:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Foo:\\\\n    def __new__(self, **args): pass\\\\n\\\\nclass Bar(Foo):\\\\n    def __init__(self, d, e, f): pass\\\\n\\\\ninspect.signature(Bar)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (d, e, f)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n![Tab completion in a Jupyter Notebook.](images/att_00006.png)\\\\n\\\\nFinally, the signature and tab completion can be restored by inheriting from the metaclass [`FixSigMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#fixsigmeta) as shown below:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass Bar(Foo, metaclass=FixSigMeta):\\\\n    def __init__(self, d, e, f): pass\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(Bar, \\\\'(d, e, f)\\\\')\\\\ninspect.signature(Bar)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (d, e, f)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n![Tab completion in a Jupyter Notebook.](images/att_00007.png)\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to define a metaclass that overrides `__call__` (as done in [`PrePostInitMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#prepostinitmeta)), you need to inherit from [`FixSigMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#fixsigmeta) instead of `type` when constructing the metaclass to preserve the signature in `__init__`. Be careful not to override `__new__` when doing this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass TestMeta(FixSigMeta):\\\\n    # __new__ comes from FixSigMeta\\\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs): pass\\\\n\\\\nclass T(metaclass=TestMeta):\\\\n    def __init__(self, a, b): pass\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(T, \\\\'(a, b)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nOn the other hand, if you fail to inherit from [`FixSigMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#fixsigmeta) when inheriting from a metaclass that overrides `__call__`, your signature will reflect that of `__call__` instead (which is often undesirable):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass GenericMeta(type):\\\\n    \\\"A boilerplate metaclass that doesn\\\\'t do anything for testing.\\\"\\\\n    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dict):\\\\n        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dict)\\\\n    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs): pass\\\\n\\\\nclass T2(metaclass=GenericMeta):\\\\n    def __init__(self, a, b): pass\\\\n\\\\n# We can avoid this by inheriting from the metaclass `FixSigMeta`\\\\ntest_sig(T2, \\\\'(*args, **kwargs)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L36)\\\\n\\\\n### PrePostInitMeta\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      PrePostInitMeta (name, bases, dict)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_A metaclass that calls optional`__pre_init__` and `__post_init__` methods_\\\\n\\\\n`__pre_init__` and `__post_init__` are useful for initializing variables or performing tasks prior to or after `__init__` being called, respectively. Fore example:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass _T(metaclass=PrePostInitMeta):\\\\n    def __pre_init__(self):  self.a  = 0; \\\\n    def __init__(self,b=0):  self.b = self.a + 1; assert self.b==1\\\\n    def __post_init__(self): self.c = self.b + 2; assert self.c==3\\\\n\\\\nt = _T()\\\\ntest_eq(t.a, 0) # set with __pre_init__\\\\ntest_eq(t.b, 1) # set with __init__\\\\ntest_eq(t.c, 3) # set with __post_init__\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nOne use for [`PrePostInitMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#prepostinitmeta) is avoiding the `__super__().__init__()` boilerplate associated with subclassing, such as used in [`AutoInit`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#autoinit).\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L47)\\\\n\\\\n### AutoInit\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      AutoInit (*args, **kwargs)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Same as`object`, but no need for subclasses to call `super().__init__`_\\\\n\\\\nThis is normally used as a [mixin](https://www.residentmar.io/2019/07/07/python-mixins.html), eg:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass TestParent():\\\\n    def __init__(self): self.h = 10\\\\n\\\\nclass TestChild(AutoInit, TestParent):\\\\n    def __init__(self): self.k = self.h + 2\\\\n\\\\nt = TestChild()\\\\ntest_eq(t.h, 10) # h=10 is initialized in the parent class\\\\ntest_eq(t.k, 12)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L52)\\\\n\\\\n### NewChkMeta\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      NewChkMeta (name, bases, dict)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Metaclass to avoid recreating object passed to constructor_\\\\n\\\\n[`NewChkMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#newchkmeta) is used when an object of the same type is the first argument to your class\\u2019s constructor (i.e. the `__init__` function), and you would rather it not create a new object but point to the same exact object.\\\\n\\\\nThis is used in [`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l), for example, to avoid creating a new object when the object is already of type [`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l). This allows the users to defenisvely instantiate an [`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l) object and just return a reference to the same object if it already happens to be of type [`L`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/foundation.html#l).\\\\n\\\\nFor example, the below class `_T` **optionally** accepts an object `o` as its first argument. A new object is returned upon instantiation per usual:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass _T():\\\\n    \\\"Testing\\\"\\\\n    def __init__(self, o): \\\\n        # if `o` is not an object without an attribute `foo`, set foo = 1\\\\n        self.foo = getattr(o,\\\\'foo\\\\',1)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nt = _T(3)\\\\ntest_eq(t.foo,1) # 1 was not of type _T, so foo = 1\\\\n\\\\nt2 = _T(t) #t1 is of type _T\\\\nassert t is not t2 # t1 and t2 are different objects\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nHowever, if we want `_T` to return a reference to the same object when passed an an object of type `_T` we can inherit from the [`NewChkMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#newchkmeta) class as illustrated below:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass _T(metaclass=NewChkMeta):\\\\n    \\\"Testing with metaclass NewChkMeta\\\"\\\\n    def __init__(self, o=None, b=1):\\\\n        # if `o` is not an object without an attribute `foo`, set foo = 1\\\\n        self.foo = getattr(o,\\\\'foo\\\\',1)\\\\n        self.b = b\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nWe can now test `t` and `t2` are now pointing at the same object when using this new definition of `_T`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nt = _T(3)\\\\ntest_eq(t.foo,1) # 1 was not of type _T, so foo = 1\\\\n\\\\nt2 = _T(t) # t2 will now reference t\\\\n\\\\ntest_is(t, t2) # t and t2 are the same object\\\\nt2.foo = 5 # this will also change t.foo to 5 because it is the same object\\\\ntest_eq(t.foo, 5)\\\\ntest_eq(t2.foo, 5)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nHowever, there is one exception to how [`NewChkMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#newchkmeta) works. **If you pass any additional arguments in the constructor a new object is returned** , even if the first object is of the same type. For example, consider the below example where we pass the additional argument `b` into the constructor:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nt3 = _T(t, b=1)\\\\nassert t3 is not t\\\\n\\\\nt4 = _T(t) # without any arguments the constructor will return a reference to the same object\\\\nassert t4 is t\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nFinally, it should be noted that [`NewChkMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#newchkmeta) as well as all other metaclases in this section, inherit from [`FixSigMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#fixsigmeta). This means class signatures will always be preserved when inheriting from this metaclass (see docs for [`FixSigMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#fixsigmeta) for more details):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ntest_sig(_T, \\\\'(o=None, b=1)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L60)\\\\n\\\\n### BypassNewMeta\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      BypassNewMeta (name, bases, dict)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Metaclass: casts`x` to this class if it\\u2019s of type `cls._bypass_type`_\\\\n\\\\n[`BypassNewMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#bypassnewmeta) is identical to [`NewChkMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#newchkmeta), except for checking for a class as the same type, we instead check for a class of type specified in attribute `_bypass_type`.\\\\n\\\\nIn NewChkMeta, objects of the same type passed to the constructor (without arguments) would result into a new variable referencing the same object. However, with [`BypassNewMeta`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#bypassnewmeta) this only occurs if the type matches the `_bypass_type` of the class you are defining:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass _TestA: pass\\\\nclass _TestB: pass\\\\n\\\\nclass _T(_TestA, metaclass=BypassNewMeta):\\\\n    _bypass_type=_TestB\\\\n    def __init__(self,x): self.x=x\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nIn the below example, `t` does not refer to `t2` because `t` is of type `_TestA` while `_T._bypass_type` is of type `TestB`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nt = _TestA()\\\\nt2 = _T(t)\\\\nassert t is not t2\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nHowever, if `t` is set to `_TestB` to match `_T._bypass_type`, then both `t` and `t2` will refer to the same object.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nt = _TestB()\\\\nt2 = _T(t)\\\\nt2.new_attr = 15\\\\n\\\\ntest_is(t, t2)\\\\n# since t2 just references t these will be the same\\\\ntest_eq(t.new_attr, t2.new_attr)\\\\n\\\\n# likewise, chaning an attribute on t will also affect t2 because they both point to the same object.\\\\nt.new_attr = 9\\\\ntest_eq(t2.new_attr, 9)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n## Metaprogramming\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L70)\\\\n\\\\n### empty2none\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      empty2none (p)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Replace`Parameter.empty` with `None`_\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L75)\\\\n\\\\n### anno_dict\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      anno_dict (f)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_`__annotation__ dictionary with`empty`cast to`None`, returning empty if doesn\\u2019t exist_\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef _f(a:int, b:L)->str: ...\\\\ntest_eq(anno_dict(_f), {\\\\'a\\\\': int, \\\\'b\\\\': L, \\\\'return\\\\': str})\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L83)\\\\n\\\\n### use_kwargs_dict\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      use_kwargs_dict (keep=False, **kwargs)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Decorator: replace`**kwargs` in signature with `names` params_\\\\n\\\\nReplace all `**kwargs` with named arguments like so:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@use_kwargs_dict(y=1,z=None)\\\\ndef foo(a, b=1, **kwargs): pass\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(foo, \\\\'(a, b=1, *, y=1, z=None)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nAdd named arguments, but optionally keep `**kwargs` by setting `keep=True`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@use_kwargs_dict(y=1,z=None, keep=True)\\\\ndef foo(a, b=1, **kwargs): pass\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(foo, \\\\'(a, b=1, *, y=1, z=None, **kwargs)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L97)\\\\n\\\\n### use_kwargs\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      use_kwargs (names, keep=False)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Decorator: replace`**kwargs` in signature with `names` params_\\\\n\\\\n[`use_kwargs`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#use_kwargs) is different than [`use_kwargs_dict`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#use_kwargs_dict) as it only replaces `**kwargs` with named parameters without any default values:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@use_kwargs([\\\\'y\\\\', \\\\'z\\\\'])\\\\ndef foo(a, b=1, **kwargs): pass\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(foo, \\\\'(a, b=1, *, y=None, z=None)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nYou may optionally keep the `**kwargs` argument in your signature by setting `keep=True`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@use_kwargs([\\\\'y\\\\', \\\\'z\\\\'], keep=True)\\\\ndef foo(a, *args, b=1, **kwargs): pass\\\\ntest_sig(foo, \\\\'(a, *args, b=1, y=None, z=None, **kwargs)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L111)\\\\n\\\\n### delegates\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      delegates (to:function=None, keep=False, but:list=None, sort_args=False)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Decorator: replace`**kwargs` in signature with params from `to`_\\\\n\\\\n| **Type** | **Default** | **Details**  \\\\n---|---|---|---  \\\\nto | function | None | Delegatee  \\\\nkeep | bool | False | Keep `kwargs` in decorated function?  \\\\nbut | list | None | Exclude these parameters from signature  \\\\nsort_args | bool | False | Sort arguments alphabetically, doesn\\u2019t work with call_parse  \\\\n  \\\\nA common Python idiom is to accept `**kwargs` in addition to named parameters that are passed onto other function calls. It is especially common to use `**kwargs` when you want to give the user an option to override default parameters of any functions or methods being called by the parent function.\\\\n\\\\nFor example, suppose we have have a function `foo` that passes arguments to `baz` like so:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef baz(a, b:int=2, c:int=3): return a + b + c\\\\n\\\\ndef foo(c, a, **kwargs):\\\\n    return c + baz(a, **kwargs)\\\\n\\\\nassert foo(c=1, a=1) == 7\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n __\\\\n\\\\nThe problem with this approach is the api for `foo` is obfuscated. Users cannot introspect what the valid arguments for `**kwargs` are without reading the source code. When a user tries tries to introspect the signature of `foo`, they are presented with this:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ninspect.signature(foo)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (c, a, **kwargs)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe can address this issue by using the decorator [`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates) to include parameters from other functions. For example, if we apply the [`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates) decorator to `foo` to include parameters from `baz`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@delegates(baz)\\\\ndef foo(c, a, **kwargs):\\\\n    return c + baz(a, **kwargs)\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(foo, \\\\'(c, a, *, b: int = 2)\\\\')\\\\ninspect.signature(foo)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (c, a, *, b: int = 2)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWe can optionally decide to keep `**kwargs` by setting `keep=True`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n@delegates(baz, keep=True)\\\\ndef foo(c, a, **kwargs):\\\\n    return c + baz(a, **kwargs)\\\\n\\\\ninspect.signature(foo)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (c, a, *, b: int = 2, **kwargs)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIt is important to note that **only parameters with default parameters are included**. For example, in the below scenario only `c`, but NOT `e` and `d` are included in the signature of `foo` after applying [`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates):\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef basefoo(e, d, c=2): pass\\\\n\\\\n@delegates(basefoo)\\\\ndef foo(a, b=1, **kwargs): pass\\\\ninspect.signature(foo) # e and d are not included b/c they don\\\\'t have default parameters.\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (a, b=1, *, c=2)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe reason that required arguments (i.e. those without default parameters) are automatically excluded is that you should be explicitly implementing required arguments into your function\\u2019s signature rather than relying on [`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates).\\\\n\\\\nAdditionally, you can exclude specific parameters from being included in the signature with the `but` parameter. In the example below, we exclude the parameter `d`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef basefoo(e, c=2, d=3): pass\\\\n\\\\n@delegates(basefoo, but= [\\\\'d\\\\'])\\\\ndef foo(a, b=1, **kwargs): pass\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(foo, \\\\'(a, b=1, *, c=2)\\\\')\\\\ninspect.signature(foo)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n<Signature (a, b=1, *, c=2)>\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nYou can also use [`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates) between methods in a class. Here is an example of [`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates) with class methods:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n# example 1: class methods\\\\nclass _T():\\\\n    @classmethod\\\\n    def foo(cls, a=1, b=2):\\\\n        pass\\\\n\\\\n    @classmethod\\\\n    @delegates(foo)\\\\n    def bar(cls, c=3, **kwargs):\\\\n        pass\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(_T.bar, \\\\'(c=3, *, a=1, b=2)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nHere is the same example with instance methods:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n# example 2: instance methods\\\\nclass _T():\\\\n    def foo(self, a=1, b=2):\\\\n        pass\\\\n\\\\n    @delegates(foo)\\\\n    def bar(self, c=3, **kwargs):\\\\n        pass\\\\n\\\\nt = _T()\\\\ntest_sig(t.bar, \\\\'(c=3, *, a=1, b=2)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nYou can also delegate between classes. By default, the [`delegates`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#delegates) decorator will delegate to the superclass:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nclass BaseFoo:\\\\n    def __init__(self, e, c=2): pass\\\\n\\\\n@delegates()# since no argument was passsed here we delegate to the superclass\\\\nclass Foo(BaseFoo):\\\\n    def __init__(self, a, b=1, **kwargs): super().__init__(**kwargs)\\\\n\\\\ntest_sig(Foo, \\\\'(a, b=1, *, c=2)\\\\')\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\n* * *\\\\n\\\\n[source](https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/fastcore/blob/main/fastcore/meta.py#L139)\\\\n\\\\n### method\\\\n\\\\n>\\\\n```\\\\n>      method (f)\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n_Mark`f` as a method_\\\\n\\\\nThe [`method`](https://fastcore.fast.ai/meta.html#method) function is used to change a function\\u2019s type to a method. In the below example we change the type of `a` from a function to a method:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\ndef a(x=2): return x + 1\\\\nassert type(a).__name__ == \\\\'function\\\\'\\\\n\\\\na = method(a)\\\\nassert type(a).__name__ == \\\\'method\\\\'\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n__\\\\n\\\\nYou can also s<TRUNCATED>\"\n",

The engineering problem at hand is optimizing the utility of those tokens against the inherent constraints of LLMs in order to consistently achieve a desired outcome. Effectively wrangling LLMs often requires thinking in context — in other words: considering the holistic state available to the LLM at any given time and what potential behaviors that state might yield.\"\n",

    "> \"Humans, however, are not the only critical stakeholders in the milieu of scientific data. Similar problems are encountered by the applications and computational agents that we task to undertake data retrieval and analysis on our behalf. These ‘computational stakeholders’ are increasingly relevant, and demand as much, or more, attention as their importance grows. One of the grand challenges of data-intensive science, therefore, is to improve knowledge discovery through assisting both humans, and their computational agents, in the discovery of, access to, and integration and analysis of, task-appropriate scientific data and other scholarly digital objects.\"\n",

    ">\"It is for this reason that humans increasingly rely on computational agents to undertake discovery and integration tasks on their behalf. This necessitates machines to be capable of autonomously and appropriately acting when faced with the wide range of types, formats, and access-mechanisms/protocols that will be encountered during their **self-guided exploration** of the global data ecosystem. It also necessitates that the machines keep an exquisite **record of provenance** such that the data they are collecting can be accurately and adequately cited. Assisting these agents, therefore, is a critical consideration for all participants in the data management and stewardship process—from researchers and data producers to data repository hosts.\"\n",
